Pantry Database
Ingredients currently available
Quantity remaining
Expiry dates (from FoodKeeper dataset or scanned labels)
Recipe Database
RecipeNLG or Forkify API or something??
Ingredient lists
Cooking times
Nutrition facts (or USDA FoodData API for calories)

for example the program can take
INPUT: [chicken, white rice, broccoli] and that the user is vegetarian, budget is less than $10, cooking time is 1 hour, as a list
then the program preprocess - filter out chicken recipes, change white rice to rice, count calories, check the user's pantry for any 
ingredients close to expiration, etc
then the model returns the vegetarian recipes only and maybe ranks by past ratings? or the user's past ratings?
the validation layer will check that the recipe fits all the constraints
OUTPUT: top ?? number of recipes AND lists of missing ingredients
