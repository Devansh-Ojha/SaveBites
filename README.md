# SaveBites
Between classes, labs, and social life, itâ€™s hard to keep track of what you have, what to cook, and when food will go bad. SaveBites addresses this by scanning receipts to track groceries, reminding you of upcoming expiration dates, suggesting recipes that utilize ingredients you already have, and recommending more informed spending habits to reduce waste.
